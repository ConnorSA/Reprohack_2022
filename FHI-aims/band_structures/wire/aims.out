  Of course, there are many other important community references, e.g., those cited in the
  above references. Our list is limited to references that describe implementations in the
  FHI-aims code. The reason is purely practical (length of this list) - please credit others as well.

          Partial memory accounting:
          | Residual value for overall tracked memory usage across tasks:     0.000000 MB (should be 0.000000 MB)
          | Peak values for overall tracked memory usage:
          |   Minimum:        2.657 MB (on task  29 after allocating d_wave)
          |   Maximum:        3.481 MB (on task   5 after allocating d_wave)
          |   Average:        3.125 MB
          | Largest tracked array allocation:
          |   Minimum:        0.727 MB (hessian_basis_wave on task  29)
          |   Maximum:        0.945 MB (hessian_basis_wave on task   5)
          |   Average:        0.852 MB
          Note:  These values currently only include a subset of arrays which are explicitly tracked.
          The "true" memory usage will be greater.

          Have a nice day.
