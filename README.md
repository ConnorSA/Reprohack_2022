Paper: Encapsulated Nanowires: Boosting Electronic Transport in Carbon Nanotubes



steps:
1 - install and configure software to however we want it/need it to work.

2 - get subsystem geomtries: push to git as .xyz files

3 - check convergence (0.01 ev/A maybe?)

4 - get ground state geometries: geomtry optimise

5 - calculate electronic band structure

6 - calculate phonon band dispersion Z-Gamma-Z

7 - electron-phonon coupling

8 - calculate 3rd derivative
