File scf.in contains information about Be@CNT system.

In order to perform the calculations for pristine CNT
modify scf.in file respetively and rerun the calculations
as following.

Sequence of QE runs for calculation of phonon dispersion and 
electron-ehonon couplings:
1) pw.x    < scf.fit.in     
2) pw.x    < scf.ph.in      
3) ph.x    < elph.in
4) q2r.x   < q2r.in
5) matdyn.x< matdyn.in

QE will generate the files with values of electron-phonon coupling constants for each q-point.
Superimposition of those values with the phonon dispersionwas used for the Fig.2 in the article.
