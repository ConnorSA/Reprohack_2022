This directory contains the data graphically represented in 
Phys. Rev. B 95, 121408 (R)

The results of iterative integration of BTE, presented on the Fig.3
are given in the IV.data file

The intergration of BTE conducted in the study requires:
1) Band structures
2) Phonon dispersions
3) Electron-phonon constants
4) Third derivatives of the force constants 

of prestine CNT and Be@CNT respectively.

The data 1)-4) was obtained with Quantum Espresso suite. The input files
for the corresponding calculations are located in the subdirectories EP and D3
