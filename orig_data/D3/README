File scf.in contains information about Be@CNT system.

In order to perform the calculations for pristine CNT
modify scf.in file respetively and rerun the calculations
as following.

Sequence of QE runs for calculation of derivative of force constants
1) pw.x < scf.in  
2) ph.x < ph.in   
3) d3.x < d3.in 

After the final run QE will create the file becnt.dyn (cnt.dyn)
files as referenced in the subdirectory ref.
